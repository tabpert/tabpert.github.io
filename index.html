      <p style="text-align: justify">
        To truly grasp reasoning ability, a Natural Language Inference model
        should be evaluated on counterfactual data. TabPert facilitates this by
        assisting in the generation of such counterfactual data for assessing
        model tabular rea- soning issues. TabPert allows a user to update a
        table, change its associated hypotheses, change their labels, and
        highlight rows that are important for hypothesis classification. TabPert
        also captures information about the techniques used to automatically
        produce the table, as well as the strategies employed to generate the
        challenging hypotheses. These counterfactual tables and hypotheses, as
        well as the metadata, can then be used to explore an existing model’s
        shortcomings methodically and quantitatively.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify">
        tldr: TabPert is a tool to augment existing tabular datasets to
        effectively and efficiently create counterfactual datasets.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      <h2>Annotation Instructions</h2>

      <p>
        This is the instructions document for using TabPert. You should watch
        <u>this video</u> to see the platform in action.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you launch TabPert in your browser and open a particular Table for
        which you wish to generate counterfactual data you will be presented
        with 3 tables (Table A, Table B, Table C) whose entries are created by
        shuffling data from similar tables.
      </p>

      <p><img src="figures/Image_0.png" /></p>

      <p>
        These automatically perturbed tables can be edited by the user manually
        according to his needs. There are two major ways to do so
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Changing the Table</strong>: In this, we change the table in the
        several ways, as described below:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Drag and drop</i>: We can drag and drop key-value pairs within the
          table and also from one table to another.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><img src="figures/Image_1.png" /></p>

      <li>
        <i>Changing the value in a particular entry</i>: We can just place our
        cursor and edit the values in a particular entry
      </li>
      <p><img src="figures/Image_2.png" /><img src="figures/Image_3.png" /></p>

      <li>
        <i>Changing the Key</i>: In this, we press the small pencil button next
        to the Key we wish to change and enter the key’s new value in the popup
      </li>
      <p><img src="figures/Image_4.png" /><img src="figures/Image_5.png" /></p>

      <li>
        Adding new entry or deleting existing entry: This can be done by using
        drag and drop along with the “add” and “delete” areas on the top of the
        tables
      </li>
      <p><img src="figures/Image_6.png" /></p>

      <p>
        <strong>Changing the hypothesis</strong>: We can also make changes in
        the hypothesis and capture the strategies used to make these changes in
        TabPert. The various ways are as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Editing the text of Hypothesis:</i> This is done similar to editing
          the value in the table, i.e. just place your cursor on the hypothesis
          you wish to edit and change it to the desired value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><img src="figures/Image_7.png" /></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Editing the Label of Hypothesis:</i> The user can use the drop-down
          menu to select the label for the hypothesis out of (“C” for
          Contradictory; “E” for Entailed and “N” for neutral)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <li>
        <i>Adding the Table Changing strategy:</i> This is done by pressing the
        “+” button next to the hypothesis which opens the following pop-up. The
        user can select the relevant rows used to arrive at the correct label
        for the hypothesis and also select the strategy the user used to change
        the hypothesis label.
      </li>

    abstract = "In this paper, we observe that semi-structured tabulated text is ubiquitous; understanding them requires not only comprehending the meaning of text fragments, but also implicit relationships between them. We argue that such data can prove as a testing ground for understanding how we reason about information. To study this, we introduce a new dataset called INFOTABS, comprising of human-written textual hypotheses based on premises that are tables extracted from Wikipedia info-boxes. Our analysis shows that the semi-structured, multi-domain and heterogeneous nature of the premises admits complex, multi-faceted reasoning. Experiments reveal that, while human annotators agree on the relationships between a table-hypothesis pair, several standard modeling strategies are unsuccessful at the task, suggesting that reasoning about tables can pose a difficult modeling challenge.", -->
